- I purposely created the user interface to be very simple for better userbility 
  and efficiency.

- Design was consistent throughout the whole interface, allowing the user to feel 
  more comfortable with the interface.

- I used a simple and eye-pleasing colour palette, material-ui's simple colored buttons 
  also allowed for this.

- Visual hierarchy where the most important information would be the focal point of the
  section, an example being the game start popup where the game code is the biggest label, 
  also since the popup is the focal point of the screen everything around it is darkened.

- Incorporated a grid-like pattern on the pages, splitting pages into two even sections 
  and also splitting pages into three even sections, allowing for a more symmetrial design, 
  being more aestetically pleasing.

- Providing information about the user's decisions, such as when they select an answer when
  playing the game the selected answer is different colour, also when results are shown
  correct answers are green and incorrect answers are red.
